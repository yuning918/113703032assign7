#113703032 oop assign7 "Dodging Objects" README.md
1. You need to dodge the object coming from top(cyan, 4*4) or left(green, 2*2).
2. The original object for player is at the middle-bottom, which is red with "p" and 4(height)*3(width).
3. There are still lots of bugs, like the game will dump a few seconds after game started
4. "a" to move left, "d" to move left, "s" to squat(height: 4 to 2), "w" to jump. 
5. Squat and jump's function are incomplete.
6. What I want is to make other obstacle generated after there is some distance between the previous one, but I failed.
7. Another incomplete function is that th obstacle should disappear after they intersect with each other.
8. Game end when player intersect with obstacle.
